# CoinPayments (CP)

This Lib make integration with [https://www.coinpayments.net](https://www.coinpayments.net/index.php?ref=5418303a5fc165090ee8a9177a3982de) in easy way.

## Initial setup

Need to setup public and private key:

1. [Register](https://www.coinpayments.net/index.php?ref=5418303a5fc165090ee8a9177a3982de)
2. Go to this [page](https://www.coinpayments.net/acct-api-keys) and generate new key.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (37).png>)

Press on button "Edit Permissions" and add API Key Permissions:

![Check all options what you need](<../.gitbook/assets/image (38).png>)

Then on bot `/setup` command:

```javascript
// Get your keys in https://www.coinpayments.net/index.php?cmd=acct_api_keys
Libs.CoinPayments.setPrivateKey("YOUR KEY");
Libs.CoinPayments.setPublicKey('YOUR KEY');

// for Receiving Payments
// Get your BB Api Key from Bots.Business App in Profile
Libs.CoinPayments.setBBApiKey('YOUR API KEY');
```

## Call API methods

All CoinPayments API method available [here](https://www.coinpayments.net/apidoc-intro).

For example for method [Get Basic Account Information](https://www.coinpayments.net/apidoc-get-basic-info) we need 2 commands: `/info` and `/onInfo`

`/info` command:

```javascript
Libs.CoinPayments.apiCall({
  fields: { cmd: "get_basic_info"},
  onSuccess: '/onInfo'
});
```

{% hint style="info" %}
In fields you can pass all fields from CoinPayments api. Just read [help](https://www.coinpayments.net/apidoc-intro). 
{% endhint %}

`/onInfo` command:

```javascript
Bot.sendMessage(inspect(options));
Bot.sendMessage("CoinPayments owner email:" + options.body.result.email);
```

## Combine libs!

CoinPayments API do not have some methods. For example get balance by address, validate address, get transactions for address and etc.

Use Block.io [Lib](https://help.bots.business/libs/blockio) with CP Lib together!

Block.io is free if you do not use wallets there.



## Receiving Payments

{% hint style="success" %}
See [demo bot](https://telegram.me/BBDemoStoreBot). Available in the Store.
{% endhint %}

It is possible to receive payment for a temporary or permanent wallet.

**Temporary wallet benefits:**

* Fixed amount
* Can bind the payment to the ordered product
* Status and checkout page
* QR code for payment
* one address for one payment

**Permanent wallet benefits:**

* Any amount
* One address for several payments
* User can transfer funds at any time

### Setup: set IPN Secret

{% hint style="warning" %}
The first step is to go to the [My Settings](https://www.coinpayments.net/index.php?cmd=acct_settings) page > **Merchant Settings**  and set a IPN Secret.

Your IPN Secret is a string of **your choosing**. Recommended to be a random string of letters, numbers, and special characters.

CoinPayments **will not send** any IPNs unless you have an IPN Secret set. 

See [more](https://www.coinpayments.net/merchant-tools-ipn)
{% endhint %}

**Once more!** You need input **any text (random text)** as IPN secret in Merchant Settings page

## Temporary wallet

We use command "create_transaction" with IPN.

Please see [https://www.coinpayments.net/apidoc-create-transaction](https://www.coinpayments.net/apidoc-create-transaction) for details.

Yes, you can write it via `Libs.CoinPayments.apiCall`method too. But there is an easier way.

####

### Command `/pay`

```javascript
let amount = 0.0001; // amount in BTC

options = {
  fields: {
     amount: amount,   // amount in BTC
     currency: "BTC",  // currency1 = currency2 = BTC
     // currency1: "BTC",   // The original currency of the transaction
     // currency2: "LTC"  //The currency the buyer will be sending
     // buyer_email: "user@example.com",
     // you can use another fields also
     // except custom and ipn_url (it used by Lib)
     // See https://www.coinpayments.net/apidoc-create-transaction
  },
  // generated wallet, QR code, payment page
  // will be available in this command
  onSuccess: '/onCreatePayment',
  
  // on successful payment this command
  // will be executed
  onPaymentCompleted: "/onPaymentCompleted",
  
  // it is not necessary
  // onIPN: "/onIPN"
  
  // if you want customize error messages
  // onError: "/onError"
}

Libs.CoinPayments.createTransaction(options);
```

{% hint style="success" %}
#### Automatically with Library:

#### CoinPayments: [IPN Retries / Duplicate IPNs](https://www.coinpayments.net/merchant-tools-ipn)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
It is preferable to use method  **`onPaymentCompleted`** and not method **`onIPN`**. 

Since the method **`onPaymentCompleted`** completely covers the IPN and solves the problem with [IPN Retries / Duplicate IPNs](https://www.coinpayments.net/merchant-tools-ipn)
{% endhint %}

### Command `/onCreatePayment`

```javascript
// You can inspect all options:
// Bot.sendMessage(inspect(options));

let result = options.result;

let msg = "*Need pay:*\n `" + result.amount + "`" + 
 "\n\n*to address:*\n" +
 "`" + result.address + "`" +
 "\n\n [Checkout](" + result.checkout_url +
    ") | [Status](" + result.status_url + 
 ")" // you can uncomment this for manual status checking
 // + "\n\nCheck status manually: /check" + options.payment_index;

Bot.sendMessage(msg);
Api.sendPhoto({ photo: result.qrcode_url }); 

```

### Command `/onPaymentCompleted`

This command will be executed on successful payment

{% hint style="info" %}
Need install ResourcesLib
{% endhint %}

```javascript
// you can inspect all options
// Bot.sendMessage(inspect(options));

if(!options){
   // for security we need to check that this command runned only by lib
   // user can not run command with options
   return
}

Bot.sendMessage("Payment completed");

let amount = options.amount1;

let res = Libs.ResourcesLib.userRes("balance");
res.add(amount)

Bot.sendMessage("added to balance, BTC: " + amount);
```

### Finished!

Now you can  receive payments



### Information about extra payments and refunds.

It is possible to define buyer email in fields for options ([see](https://help.bots.business/libs/coinpayments#command-pay) code for command /pay )

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Please note:** CoinPayments do not send you extra payments. CoinPayments send just email to buyer (or you) about refund for that extra.

Also no any information about such extra in CP Panel or IPN. Be careful
{% endhint %}



### Additional Information

You can check payment status

```javascript
Libs.CoinPayments.getTxInfo({
  payment_index: payment_index,  // see /onCreatePayment command.
                                    // Need pass this payment_index to this command
  onSuccess: '/on_txn_id'
})
```

#### `command: /on_txn_id: `

```javascript
// You can inspect all options:
// Bot.sendMessage(inspect(options));

Bot.sendMessage(options.result.status_text);

// Do not finish payment here.
// Use /onPaymentCompleted for this
```

#### `command /onIPN`

You can get info from IPN. Really it is not needed in simple. Just use onPaymentCompleted option on createTransaction.

```javascript
// You can inspect all fields:
// Bot.sendMessage(inspect(options))

// IPN is not needed
// Use - onPaymentCompleted

Bot.sendMessage("IPN: Payment status: " + options.status_text );

```

#### `command onError`

```javascript
// You can inspect all fields:
Bot.sendMessage(inspect(options))
```

###

## Permanent wallet

We use command "get_callback_address" with IPN.

Please see [https://www.coinpayments.net/apidoc-get-callback-address](https://www.coinpayments.net/apidoc-get-callback-address) for details.

Yes, you can write it via `Libs.CoinPayments.apiCall`method too. But there is an easier way.



### Command `/createWallet`

```javascript
Libs.CoinPayments.createPermanentWallet({
  currency: "BTC",
  //label: "myLabel",
  onSuccess: "/onWalletCreate",
  
  // onIPN - not necessary
  //onIPN: "/onPermanentWalletIPN",
  
  onIncome: "/onIncome"
  
  // if you want customize error messages
  // onError: "/onError"
});
```

{% hint style="success" %}
#### Automatically with Library:

#### CoinPayments: [IPN Retries / Duplicate IPNs](https://www.coinpayments.net/merchant-tools-ipn)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
It is preferable to use method  **`onIncome`** and not method **`onIPN`**. 

Since the method **`onIncome`** completely covers the IPN and solves the problem with [IPN Retries / Duplicate IPNs](https://www.coinpayments.net/merchant-tools-ipn)
{% endhint %}

### Command `/onWalletCreate`

```javascript
//Bot.sendMessage(inspect(options));

let wallet = options.result.address;
Bot.sendMessage("Your permanent wallet address is:\n`" + wallet + "`")

// You can save wallet
//User.setProperty("wallet", wallet, "string");
```

### Command `/onIncome`

```javascript
// anybody can run /onIncome command!

if(!options){
   // for security we need to check that this command runned only by lib
   // user can not run command with options
   return
}

let wallet = options.address;
let currency = options.currency;
let amount = options.amount;

let fiat_amount = options.fiat_amount;
let fiat_currency = options.fiat_coin;

let fee = options.fee;

let txn_id = options.txn_id

// see another fields by
// Bot.sendMessage(inspect(options));

Bot.sendMessage(
   "*Income to wallet:*" +
   "\n`"+ wallet + "`" +
   "\n\n*Amount*:\n" +
amount + " " + currency + " (" + fiat_amount + " " + fiat_currency + ")" +
   "\n*Fee*: " + fee +
   "\n\nTXN: `" + txn_id + "`"
);

```



#### `command onError`

```javascript
// You can inspect all fields:
Bot.sendMessage(inspect(options))
```





## Troubleshooting & Debuging

* Do not use same CoinPayment account for receiving and transfering funds.
* Go to [page](https://www.coinpayments.net/index.php?cmd=acct_balances\&action=deposits). This list must have history with completed income transaction(s)
* Try to resend IPN - see Debuging
* Verify that you have [set IPN secret](https://help.bots.business/libs/coinpayments#set-ipn-secret)

### IPN History

You can view IPN History by link [https://www.coinpayments.net/acct-ipn-history](https://www.coinpayments.net/acct-ipn-history)

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (42).png>)

Also you can resend IPN by checkin "Resend" checkbox and button "Re-send checked IPN(s)"

### Test methods

#### Temporary wallet:

Also it is possible **make test onPaymentCompleted** event. It is good if you do not want make test payment.

```javascript
options = {
  onPaymentCompleted: "/onPaymentCompleted 0.75"
}

Libs.CoinPayments.callTestPaymentCompleted(options);
```

####

#### Permanent wallet:

Also it is possible **make test **callTestPermanentWalletIncome event. It is good if you do not want make test payment.

```javascript
options = {
  // onIPN: "/onPermanentWalletIPN",  // if you need IPN also
  onIncome: "/onIncome",
  
  // not necessary options
  // you can pass amount
  //amount: 0.5
  // txn_id: YOUR_TXN_ID
}

Libs.CoinPayments.callTestPermanentWalletIncome(options);
```



## Security

{% hint style="warning" %}
It is strongly recommended to pay attention to safety when using this library.
{% endhint %}

**Do not use default names** for secure commands such as `/onIncome`, `/onPaymentCompleted`

Anybody can run any command by names. So need to check that security command runned by CoinPayment Lib only!

```javascript
if(!options){
   // for security we need to check that this command runned only by lib
   // user can not run command with options
   return
}

// your secure code
...
```

{% hint style="danger" %}
Do not use any non official libs now. 

* Any lib can run command with options.
* Any libs can read properties (and read your API Keys from other lib)

We have not way to protect this now. Just **not use NON official libs** with CP lib. Well, that now there are no such libraries
{% endhint %}



**Grant only the really necessary permissions for the Api key.** If yor bot do not need "create_withdrawal" or etc methods - turn theys off. 

![Check all options what you need](<../.gitbook/assets/image (38).png>)

Read more about security [here](https://help.bots.business/scenarios-and-bjs/bjs-security)

### Do not process any before payment!

Any API commands can have errors: API errors, timeout errors, network errors, and other errors.

You need to withdraw, make deposit income only on success!

Because if you get an error, such a conclusion, replenishment of the deposit, etc. - will always be!

![Here the balance will always be replenished, even if half of the Internet falls](<../.gitbook/assets/image (88).png>)
