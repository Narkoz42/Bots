You definitely need a table header. Make it.

**2.** From your Google Sheet, from the _Tools_ menu select _Script Editor_

**3.** Paste the script from [above](https://gist.github.com/bots-business/b627418423a2c5df3b4ed329181077f0) into the script code editor and hit _Save._

**4.** From the _Publish_ menu, select _Deploy as web appâ€¦_\
\
**5.** Choose to execute the app as **yourself**, and allow _**Anyone**, even **anonymous**_ to execute the script. (Note, depending on your Google Apps instance, this option may not be available. You will need to contact your Google Apps administrator, or else use a Gmail account.) Now click _Deploy_. You may be asked to review permissions now. **Project version** - always "New".

**6.** The URL that you get will be the webhook that you need use in this Lib. You can test this webhook in your browser first by pasting it. Note that depending on your Google Apps instance, you may need to adjust the URL to make it work.&#x20;

**`/setup`**

```javascript
// replace with your URL, obtained in step 6
Libs.GoogleSpreadSheet.setUrl("https://script.google.com/macros/*******");
```
