# BlockIO

This Lib make integration with [block.io](blockio.md) in easy way.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (26).png>)

## With Block.io you can

* create new wallets: Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Litecoin
* look transactions
* accept payments
* make withdraws
* etc

## Demo bot

See [DemoBlockIOBot](https://telegram.me/DemoBlockIOBot). It also available in the Store.

See [docs](https://help.bots.business/store/blockiobot) about this bot.



## Initial setup

Need to set Api key and secret pin in first. You can create command `/init` with such BJS:

```javascript
// set secret PIN
Libs.BlockIO.setSecretPin("YOURS SECRET PIN");

Libs.BlockIO.Bitcoin.setApiKey("YOURS_API_KEY for Bitcoin");
Libs.BlockIO.Dogecoin.setApiKey("YOURS_API_KEY for Dogecoin");
Libs.BlockIO.Litecoin.setApiKey("YOURS_API_KEY for Litecoin");

// Testnet
Libs.BlockIO.testNet.Bitcoin.setApiKey("YOURS_API_KEY for Bitcoin");
Libs.BlockIO.testNet.Dogecoin.setApiKey("YOURS_API_KEY for Dogecoin");
Libs.BlockIO.testNet.Litecoin.setApiKey("YOURS_API_KEY for Litecoin");
```

Just run bot and execute this command `/init`. Then you can remove it.

{% hint style="warning" %}
You get Secret PIN from Block.io by e-mail
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
You get API keys in Block.io [dashboard](https://block.io/dashboard) by link "Show API Keys"
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
You can also provide pin and api key in commands in options
{% endhint %}

## Methods

All methods from [https://block.io/api](https://block.io/api/simple/) available in the Lib.

You can run it via command:

```javascript
Libs.BlockIO.XXXcoin.methodYYY(
    { onSuccess: "/onNewAddress",
      onError: "/onerror",
      // ....
      // OTHER POSSIBLE PARAMS - see are later
} );
```

{% hint style="info" %}
XXXCoin - it is Bitcoin, Litecoin or Dogecoin&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
You can also use Testnet: Libs.BlockIO.testNet.XXXcoin
{% endhint %}

&#x20;Full methods docs [here](https://block.io/api/)

So if you need, for example, getTransactions method for Litecoin change this code:

```javascript
Libs.BlockIO.XXXcoin.methodYYY(
    { onSuccess: "/onNewAddress",
      onError: "/onerror",
      // ....
      // OTHER POSSIBLE PARAMS
} );
```

to:

```javascript
Libs.BlockIO.Litecoin.getTransactions(
    { onSuccess: "/onGetTransaction",
      onError: "/onerror",
      // ....
      // OTHER POSSIBLE PARAMS
} );
```

### What it is - "OTHER POSSIBLE PARAMS" ?

It can be:

* api\_key and pin. If you do not set [here](https://help.bots.business/libs/blockio#initial-setup)  (for all methods)
* label, address (for getNewAddress methods and etc)
* labels, addresses
* to\_addresses, from\_addresses, from\_labels (for withdraw )
* page
* transaction\_ids (for isGreenTransaction method)
* type (for getTransactions method)

{% hint style="info" %}
See available params in [https://block.io/api](https://block.io/api/) page
{% endhint %}

###

### Example for getNewAddress

For example: "Actions for Handling Addresses"

From block.io [help](https://block.io/api/):&#x20;

![from Block.io help - https://block.io/api](<../.gitbook/assets/image (24).png>)

So we have API method "Get New Address":

```javascript
Libs.BlockIO.Bitcoin.getNewAddress(
    { onSuccess: "/onNewAddress",
      onError: "/onerror"
} );
```

This function getNewAddress have 2 callbacks: `onSuccess` and `onError`.

`onSuccess` callback command `/onNewAddress` will be runned:

```javascript
let wallet = options;  // we have Block.io response in options

// uncomment this line for inspecting all options
// Bot.sendMessage(inspect(options));

Bot.sendMessage(
    "*New wallet* was created. \n  #⃣Wallet: `" + 
    wallet.address + "`\n  🏷Label: `" +
    wallet.label + "`"
);
```



### Example for making Withdraw

![from Block.io help - https://block.io/api](<../.gitbook/assets/image (25).png>)

{% hint style="success" %}
We know about params: `to_addresses` and `from_labels` from block.io [help](https://block.io/api/). See "Withdraw From Labels" method there
{% endhint %}

Transfer coin from Block.io wallet with label "default" to any wallet:

```javascript
Libs.BlockIO.Bitcoin.withdrawFromLabels(
    { to_addresses:"3KyRZdjJCpHjHfnjaELvrDpNAxUE3D1NK4",
      from_labels:"default",
      amounts:0.002,
      onSuccess: "/onwithdraw", onError: "/onerror"
});
```

onWithdraw command:&#x20;

```javascript
Bot.sendMessage(inspect(options))
```

###

### Error handing

You can show error message from Block.io

```javascript
Bot.sendMessage("Error");

if(options&&options.data){
  Bot.sendMessage(options.data.error_message);
}

```



## How to...

### Open new BTC address for each user (chat)?

possible BJS for command /newAddress:

```javascript
Libs.BlockIO.Bitcoin.getNewAddress(
    { 
      label: "chat" + chat.chatid,
      onSuccess: "/onNewAddress",
      onError: "/onError",
} );
```

command /onNewAddress:

```javascript
Bot.sendMessage(inspect(options));
Bot.sendMessage("Created: " + options.address);
```

command /onError:

```javascript
Bot.sendMessage("Error happens on wallet creation");
```



### How can I check any payment by user on [block.io](http://block.io/) if I know him bitcoin address and payment will be 0,0001 Bitcoin?

Looks like you need to receive payments on one own wallet from several users.&#x20;

It is bad practice:

1. User must say his wallet before payment. Because after payment anybody can see any addresses in blockchain
2. User can do mistake with his address wallet
3. User can do mistake with amount

{% hint style="danger" %}
Thus, users will have incorrect operations. You should check them in manual mode. It will be very difficult for you to verify incorrect transactions in the blockchain.
{% endhint %}

More good practice it is generate new income address for each payment. It is more secure.&#x20;
