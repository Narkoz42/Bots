# Groups

## What it is: "allowed only for group"?

Users can be members of the group.&#x20;

For example, there may be a group of "customers" and "guests." Then you can make sure that guests can not execute client commands.

![Group can be modified on command editing](<../.gitbook/assets/image (88).png>)

{% hint style="info" %}
You can use BJS code for adding user to group:`User.addToGroup(group_name)`&#x20;
{% endhint %}
