# Aliases

### What it is aliases?

Sometimes it is convenient to set aliases. For example, include aliases `/phone, /email` to command `/contacts`.\
Then `/contacts` - it is command name. Others - it's aliases.

A much more useful case: set aliases for **keyboard** keys. Quite pleasant "contact" on the button, than "/contacts"
